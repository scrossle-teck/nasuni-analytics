# Work Package Addendums — “What’s already done?” and “What’s left?”

These addendums map the work packages (WP00–WP10) to **existing completed work** in the two repos:

- Collector / evidence acquisition: [scrossle-teck/nasuni-inventory](https://github.com/scrossle-teck/nasuni-inventory)
- Analytics / Parquet + DuckDB + rules: this repo (`nasuni-analytics`)

Each addendum has two jobs:

1. Identify **available completed work** that can be leveraged immediately.
2. Provide a **concrete checklist** of steps required to meet the WP’s acceptance criteria.
